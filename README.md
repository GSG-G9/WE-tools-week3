## App discreption

### We are:

- Hassan
- Mohammed
- Adham

We built this app that shows informations about Time, weather, and currency in different cities around the world.

## Why we did that?

- We built this app to help people who are intersting in traveling and money exchange. It will keep you up to date with informations about cities around the world.

## How we did that?

we started thinking about helpful services, we thouth about building health advices app, which send advices to users based on wether case.

Then we try to search for APIs that shows world news but we did not found any appropriate APIs.

Finally after long discutions we found this idea whould be helpful and usefull, for almost all people around the world.

We sperate the app to two main section. One is about front end, and the other is about APIs and logic sutff.Each section has its own issues.
Sometimes we worked in issues indivesually, and sometimes we worked in pairs.
