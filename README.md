### As a user:

2. I can know time, weather, and currency about each city.
3. I can add new cards to display in the screen.
4. I can choose what city to dispaly in each card.
5. I can make currency change.

## Why we did that?

- We built this app to help people who are intersting in traveling and money exchange. It will keep you up to date with informations about cities around the world.

## How we did that?

- we started thinking about offer a helpful services, we thouth about building health advices, that be sent to users based on wether case.
  Then we tryed to search for APIs that offer world news but we did not found any helpfull APIs.
- Finally after long discutions we found this idea whould be helpful and usefull, for almost all people around the world.

- We sperate the app to two main section. One is about front end, and the other is about APIs and logic sutff.Each section has its own issues.
  Sometimes we worked in issues indivesually, and sometimes we worked in pairs.displaytrech goals
